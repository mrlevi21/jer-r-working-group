# jer-r-working-group
A place to share sample code for various R projects to facilitate the R working group

When uploading a script that depends on external data, please include sample input files, either the ones the script was written to work with or dummy files that are formatted correctly. Feel free to include explanatory readme files if you feel they're necessary or helpful as well.

Create a new subfolder for new scripts! When entring the filename in the box at the top, type in the name of the subfolder and / to start working there or create it if it doesn't exist yet. For example "nelson/readme.txt" would move to or create the subfolder nelson and then the file being edited would be saved as readme.txt there.
